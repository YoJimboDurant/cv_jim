Using R to Characterizing Community Exposure to Environmental Contaminants.,Oct-15,"International Society of Exposure Science, annual meeting. Henderson, NV","Analysis of contaminant data from environmental media presents multiple, sometimes simultaneous, issues in determining exposure levels to community members. Environmental exposure measurements may be sparse in terms of number or locations. Sampling locations may not be proximate to the locations of the populations. In the data available, it is typical to find analytic results below detection limits, which can further complicate the analysis. There may also be strong seasonal trends, autocorrelations, or other deterministic factors driving community exposures that should be accounted for in determining trend or central tendency measures in the data. This presentation highlights tools for in characterizing and understanding environmental exposure data, and its packages for visualizing, modeling environmental data, and computing summary statistics with censored data using the R statistical programming language."
