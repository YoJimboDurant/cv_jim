Using R to Characterizing Community Exposure to Environmental Contaminants.,10/19/2015,"International Society of Exposure Science, annual meeting. Henderson, NV","Analysis of contaminant data from environmental media presents multiple, sometimes simultaneous, issues in determining exposure levels to community members. Environmental exposure measurements may be sparse in terms of number or locations. Sampling locations may not be proximate to the locations of the populations. In the data available, it is typical to find analytic results below detection limits, which can further complicate the analysis. There may also be strong seasonal trends, autocorrelations, or other deterministic factors driving community exposures that should be accounted for in determining trend or central tendency measures in the data. This presentation highlights tools for in characterizing and understanding environmental exposure data, and its packages for visualizing, modeling environmental data, and computing summary statistics with censored data using the R statistical programming language.",JT Durant
Estimating exposure to air pollutants from a pulp and paper mill in a coastal NW Washington community.,10/16/2017,"International Society of Exposure Science, annual meeting. RTP, NC","ATSDR developed a two-stage approach of using screening level modeling (human exposure model [HEM-3]) and refined CALPUFF modeling to estimate pollutant levels in a coastal community bounded by complex terrain. Emission estimates from many point and area sources for a variety of air pollutants were included in the screening model runs. Modeled concentrations were compared to carcinogenic, chronic, and acute health effect screening levels to determine which species should be included in refined modeling. Nine of the 35 pollutants evaluated in the screening model were retained in the refined modeling. Refined modeling using CALPUFF was conducted because of known complex wind fields in the area due to coastal and terrain effects. Gridded Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) data were incorporated into the model to characterize the complex atmospheric flow in the region. Five year average concentrations were used to assess potential for carcinogenic effects, maximum one year averages were used to assess potential for chronic non-carcinogenic effects, and maximum 1- or 24-hour concentrations were used to assess potential for acute effects. An emission rate distribution approach for acute concentrations was employed to account for unknown short-term variability in emission rates. All nine of the species retained in the refined modeling were modeled to exceed screening levels for at least one of the three health effects considered. Spatial distributions of receptors exceeding screening levels were determined as well as estimates of how frequently acute screening levels might be exceeded at each model receptor. Results of this modeling study are being used to design an ambient air monitoring study that incorporates temporal and spatial variations by identifying pollutants of interest, locations where maximum air concentrations are expected, and times of year when meteorological conditions result in higher predicted concentrations.","B.

"Spatial, temporal and meteorological trends in benzene air concentrations in Corpus Christi Refinery Row, Texas.",10/16/2017,"International Society of Exposure Science, annual meeting. RTP, NC","Using the R package, openair, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) analyzed spatial, temporal, and meteorological effects on benzene air concentrations near petrochemical facilities in Corpus Christi, Texas. ATSDR used data collected by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (1994-2010), the Corpus Christi Air Quality Project (2005-2010), and industry sponsored monitoring (1996-2010). Temporal resolution of the monitoring data from these three networks ranged from 15-minute or 1-hour auto gas chromatograph data (Auto GC) to 24-hour 97 SUMMA™ canister samples. Cross-network concentrations were comparable at sites geographically closest to each other, with the relationships affected by wind direction. The data for all three networks showed strong seasonality, with higher concentrations occurring during the winter and autumn. The Auto GC monitors showed a strong diurnal pattern. Over time, concentrations of benzene decreased across all networks and monitoring locations. Conditional probability polar plots indicated higher levels of benzene associated with emissions from petrochemical facilities, with transportation sources also influencing some monitoring locations. To address how well these monitoring locations captured spatial variability from stationary sources of benzene, AERMOD version 15181 was used to model point and area source emissions from the 2011 National Air Toxics Assessment for Nueces County. Modeled benzene concentrations were less than monitored results by a factor of 2-6, depending on the monitor location. However, the model results captured the seasonality and spatial variability seen in the monitoring data and indicated that these monitoring locations were well-situated to capture high mean and 24-hour concentrations of benzene from the petrochemical plants.","J.
